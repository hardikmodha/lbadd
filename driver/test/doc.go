// Package test contains all integration tests that were created as regression
// tests for issues that were fixed. Every test has to be named
// TestIssue<number>, and the file issue<number>_test.go, to clearly identify,
// which issue the test originated from. If there are multiple tests for this
// issue, please run them as sub-tests. See issue62.go for an example and
// additional info.
